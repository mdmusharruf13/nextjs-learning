## Next.js

### Routing

Next.js has a file-system based routing system.

URLs you can access in your browser are determined by how you organize your files and folder in your code.

### Routing conventions

1. All routes must live inside the app folder.

2. Route file must be named either page.js or page.tsx.

3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path.

When these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route.
